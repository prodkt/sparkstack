> Accessible and customizable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Free. Open Source. **Use this to build your own component library**. Built on top of shadcn/ui.

> <sup>For the most part this repo is maintained by shadcn/ui. I fetch the upstream to keep up to date but extend upon on it when I must. I've consistently found myself pulling shadcn/ui components into projects and spending more time than I'd like in the setup, and customizations. These are some of my baseline adjustments I pull when I need to get something up running quickly. Feel free to use open source.</sup>
